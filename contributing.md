# Contributing Guide

:grinning: Haiii~ thank you for considering contributing to one of my projects

Here some guidelines to follow :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Contribute

Contributions aren't exclusively code. Additional ones can include:

- Fixing typos
- Improving documentation
- Voicing your opinion _constructively_ in a _relevant context_

If you're fixing a typo or notice a small peculiarity, don't hesitate to quickly make a PR ^w^

## Issues

- Search for existing (even closed) issues before creating a possibly duplicate one
- Don't _bump_ issues

## Pull Requests

- If the changes are large or breaking,
- Don't perform unrelated changes
- Adhere to the existing code style
- Double-check your changes by reading the diff view
- Make a PR from a branch different from the default one
