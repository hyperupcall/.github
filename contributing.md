# Contributing Guide

:grinning: Haiii~ thank you for considering contributing to one of my projects

Succinctly, I try to reciprocate your effort by responding with effort of an equivalent order of magnitude, but definitely don't expect it. Please understand that Open Source is often a thankless job and maintainers like myself have other priorities like School, Work, Family, etc.

For more details, I have some guidelines below :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Contribute

Contributions aren't exclusively code, and can also include:

- Fixing typos
- Improving documentation
- Voicing your opinion _constructively_

If you're fixing a typo or notice a small peculiarity, don't hesitate to quickly make a PR ^w^

## Issues

- If there is an issue template, please fill it out. I may close issues if I can't work with the little information you give me
- Try your best to avoid duplicating issues by searching for an existing equivalent before you open a new one
- Don't needlessly _bump_ issues. Like seriously, if you don't see any recent updates, then there aren't any! Same thing with those "+1" comments - that's what the emojis are for

## Pull Requests

- If the changes are large or breaking, please open an issue first
- Don't perform unrelated changes
- Adhere to the existing code style
- Please pouble-check your changes by reading the diff view
- You must make PRs from a branch that's different than the default one
